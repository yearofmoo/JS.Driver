# JS.Driver

JS.Driver is a cross-framework JavaScript wrapper designed for JavaScript plugin development.

JS.Driver provides a consistant API featuring DOM manipulation, animations, ajax and JSON.


## Supported Frameworks

- jQuery


## Plugin Development

This library is designed as a dependency for plugin development in JavaScript. Long gone are the days when a plugin needs to be designed individually for various JavaScript frameworks. Just design your plugin using the JS.Driver API and then include the correct JS.Driver file and you're done.
